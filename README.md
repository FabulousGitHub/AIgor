‚ú® Features
Multimodal Input/Output: Supports text, image, and audio generation.

Natural Language Processing: Understands and processes complex user requests using the Gemini model.

Web Search: Finds relevant information online using the Google Search API.

Map Search: Retrieves geographic data and locations via OpenStreetMap.

Text-to-Speech: Converts text responses into audio messages using Edge TTS.

Smart Command Routing: Intelligently parses user intent and routes requests to the appropriate service.

Reminder Notes: Create and manage notes with reminders (implementation details in code).

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The bot is designed as a sophisticated request-processing pipeline:

User Input: A user sends a message via the Telegram API.

Request Reception: The Telegram Bot server receives and forwards the request.

Intent Recognition: The heart of the system. The user's prompt, along with context, is sent to a lightweight LLM (e.g., Gemini Flash 1.5 8B) to determine the user's intent and the specific command to execute.

API Routing: Based on the parsed command, the bot routes the request to the appropriate specialized API:

Gemini Pro/Flas h - For advanced text generation and conversation.

Kandinsky - For image generation.

Google Search API - For fetching information from the web.

OpenStreetMap (Nominatim) - For geocoding and map data.

Edge TTS - For converting text to speech.

Response Handling: The bot receives the response from the external API, formats it, and sends the final result back to the user through the Telegram API.

This architecture allows for efficient and scalable handling of diverse and complex user queries by leveraging the best tools for each task.
